InspirePlayed Plugin for Bukkit

This is my first plugin for my Bukkit Minecraft Server at inspire.dre.am:25588!

Purpose: This plugin tracks the amount of time players spend online.

Features:
-Players can type /played to see their own playtime
-Players can type /played <player> to see another player's playtime
-Will send message to player giving days, hours, and minutes spent online
-Players' names are not case sensitive
-User data saved to playtimes.dat (not user editable)
-File saves occur when a player quits or types /played

Planned Features (in order):
-Send back original capitalization of player's name
-use MySQL
-add configurable file to change colours and prefix
-detect afk players and do not track their aft time
-promote users to next rank after certain amount of time
