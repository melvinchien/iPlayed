Bukkit Plugin

This is my first plugin for my Bukkit Minecraft Server!
This plugin (I hope) will be able to track the playtime of users on my server.

To Do (in order):
-implement /played basic feature
-use MySQL
-add configurable file to change colours and prefix
-detect afk players
-promote users to next rank after certain amount of time
